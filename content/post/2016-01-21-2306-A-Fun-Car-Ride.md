I was driving with the girls in the car today on the way to see Sarah at colorguard. It was just getting dark and
Sophie sees the moon. 

> Daddy, what kind of moon is that?

> Waxing Gibbous.

> WAXING GIBBOUS!?!? I LOVE WAXING GIBBOUS!!

Daddy's little astronomer.

A little later she was telling me about a "dead animal" she found at the park with her friends.

> It was a bird and an owl ate it and it had a skeleton. Not an exoskeloton, just a regular skeleton.

Gross.
