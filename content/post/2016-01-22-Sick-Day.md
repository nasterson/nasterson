Amelia slept in our bed last night because she was pretty sick. Her sinus infection is so bad her eyes are almost sealed shut from 
the gunk in them.

We went to the doctor this morning and found out Millie and Olivia both have pink eye. So that is fun.

My favorite tidbit from olivia on the way home with her lollipop: 

> This lollipop tastes like me! Like apples and like me.

I'm not sure whether to be amused or terrified.
